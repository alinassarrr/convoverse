<!-- AI Workflow -->
## üß† AI Workflow -> Two-Agent System  

| AI Agents Workflow |
| ------------------------------------- |
|<img src="./readme/demo/ai-flow.png"/> |

<br>
ConvoVerse‚Äôs AI runs on two powerful agents:  
one that keeps conversations summarized automatically, and another that answers your questions across all platforms.  

---

### Agent 1: Conversation Summarization (Automatic)  

This agent works in the background, making sure conversations never get out of hand.  

**How it works:**  
- **Triggers:**  
  - Every **5‚Äì10 minutes**  
  - When a conversation passes a message threshold  
  - Or when old messages have been waiting too long  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Monitors conversations across Slack, Gmail, and more  
  2. Collects new messages and enriches them with user info  
  3. Builds context from past summaries and conversation history  
  4. Uses AI (Gemini) to:  
     - Create a fresh **summary**  
     - Extract **action items** (tasks, deadlines, events)  
  5. Saves everything to the database and marks messages as summarized  
  6. Loops back to monitor again  

**Output:** Always up-to-date summaries with clear action lists.  

---

### Agent 2: Query Response (On Demand)  

This is the agent you talk to directly ‚Äî your personal conversation assistant.  

**How it works:**  
- **Trigger:** When you ask a question through the interface  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Receives and secures the query (filters unsafe inputs)  
  2. Understands intent (question, task lookup, summary request, etc.)  
  3. Converts your query into embeddings and searches across:  
     - Saved Messages
     - Previously Generated Summaries and Actions
  4. Builds context
  5. Generates a natural answer with references
  6. Returns the response and keeps the session open for follow-ups  

**Output:** Fast, clear answers powered by your entire workspace.  

---

### Key Technical Features  

- **Vector Search & Embeddings** ‚Äì Gemini embeddings + cosine similarity across messages, summaries, and actions  
- **Smart Triggers** ‚Äì Message count + time-based checks prevent missed updates  
- **Context Continuity** ‚Äì **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation) ensures summaries connect smoothly over time  
- **Multi-Platform Support** ‚Äì Works across Slack, Gmail, and more, with a unified data model  

---

### Why It Matters  

Together, these agents act as your **conversation brain**:  
- Summaries + actions delivered automatically  
- No tasks or deadlines slip through the cracks  
- Instant answers, no matter where the info lives  
- Smarter over time with continuous context building

### Linear Workflow  
To keep development structured and transparent, every feature and bug fix was tracked through **Linear** and linked directly with GitHub:  

-  **Branching:** Each ticket started with a dedicated Git branch, keeping changes isolated and organized.  
-  **Commits:** Code was committed regularly with clear, descriptive messages referencing the Linear ticket.  
-  **Collaboration:** Changes were pushed to the remote repository, ensuring the team stayed in sync.  
-  **Pull Requests:** A PR was opened for review, enabling feedback, discussion, and quality checks.  
   **Integration with Linear:** PRs were linked to their tickets, automatically updating progress and status.  
-  **Done:** Once merged, the ticket was moved to **‚ÄúDone‚Äù**, completing the development cycle smoothly.
